    <p>If you couldn't tell by the name of the page, I'm going to talk about
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike" 
          title="What is a Roguelike?" 
          target="_blank"> roguelikes </a> 
          (which happens to be my <strong> favorite </strong> game genre!)
          I happen to love this genre for many reasons! The procedurally
          generated maps and random items tend to keep the game fresh. In additon to keeping the game fresh,
          it also encourages a bunch of replayability. To me, I love the <strong> biggest bang for my buck</strong>,
          so these tend to be my go-to genre! My favorite game would have to Binding of Isaac: Rebirth
          (click the image for the Steam Store link).
